Features and How It Works
Responsive Design
The website is designed to be fully responsive using CSS media queries. This ensures that the layout adapts to various screen sizes, providing an optimal experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
CSS Styling
Flexbox and CSS Grid layouts are used for responsive and flexible page layouts.
Interactive elements (such as buttons, links, and form fields) are styled using CSS pseudoclasses (like :hover, :active, and :focus) to enhance user interaction.
Smooth transitions and animations are implemented for dynamic effects when interacting with buttons and other elements.
Icons and Typography
Proper Font Awesome icons are used for each skill, making the section visually appealing and easy to read.
The typography has been carefully selected for readability, with appropriate fonts, sizes, and spacing.
Professional Contact Form
The contact form is styled to be clean, organized, and user-friendly. Visitors can easily reach out by filling out the form with their name, email, and message.
Technologies Used
HTML5 and CSS3 for layout and styling.
